# Share Analyzer (Phase 1)

Read-only crawler and analyzer for enterprise network shares. Builds a SQLite
index of every file's metadata and content fingerprint, then produces
interactive HTML and machine-readable exports suitable for scoping a RAG
ingestion project.

Phase 1 is intentionally narrow: index a mounted share, generate six reports,
hand off a `rag_candidates.jsonl` to the downstream pipeline.

## Quick start

```bash
# install (Python 3.12+, Poetry 2.x)
poetry install

# crawl a share into a SQLite index
poetry run share-analyzer scan /mnt/share --db share.sqlite --workers 8

# generate every report into ./out
poetry run share-analyzer report all --db share.sqlite --out ./out

# inspect the latest run
poetry run share-analyzer info --db share.sqlite

# or launch the desktop UI: pick a folder, start/rescan/report by clicking
poetry run share-analyzer ui
```

The HTML reports are self-contained single files — Plotly is inlined, no CDN —
so they can be emailed or dropped on a SharePoint without hosting.

## Desktop UI

`share-analyzer ui` opens a Tkinter window with:

- A native OS folder picker for the share to scan and the index DB.
- A "Choose subfolders…" button that opens a tree picker: drill into
  the chosen root, double-click (or press Space, or use the
  Include/Exclude buttons) to toggle individual subfolders. Excluded
  subtrees show a `✗`, partially-excluded parents show `◐`. Subtrees
  are loaded on demand as you expand them, so a 4 TB share opens
  instantly. Selections are scoped to the current root and are
  cleared automatically if the root changes.
- Workers / dir-workers / hash-cap controls and the same default-exclude
  toggle as the CLI.
- A live progress line (`12,345 files   3 err   …/share/foo/bar.md`)
  refreshed during the scan.
- A runs table that lists every prior run in the chosen DB with
  status, file/error counts, and a "vs #N" marker on rescans.
- Buttons to **rescan** against a selected run, **generate reports**
  into a folder of your choice (with an "open the folder?" prompt
  on completion), and show **details** for any run.
- A **Dry-run** checkbox that walks the share without writing anything
  and shows file/folder counts + top extensions in a popup.

The UI is a thin wrapper around the same orchestrator the CLI uses —
no parallel implementation, no duplicate state.

On Linux you may need `apt-get install python3-tk` if your distro
ships a stripped Python.

## Reports

| Name                | Output           | What it answers                                         |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `topology`          | HTML treemap, CSV | Folder tree to depth 4, sized by bytes, coloured by MIME |
| `size_hotspots`     | HTML, CSV         | Top 50 largest folders at depths 1–4                     |
| `staleness`         | HTML, CSV         | Files bucketed by latest mtime (<1y, 1–3y, 3–5y, 5y+)    |
| `duplication`       | HTML, CSV         | Top duplicate clusters by wasted space                   |
| `type_distribution` | HTML, CSV         | Counts/sizes per MIME category and per top-20 extension  |
| `rag_candidates`    | JSONL             | Files matching the default ingestion filters             |

The default RAG filter is: `mime_category = text-extractable`,
`1 KB ≤ size ≤ 50 MB`, modified within the last 5 years, one canonical copy
per duplicate cluster.

## CLI

```
share-analyzer scan <path> [--db <file.db>]
                  [--workers 8] [--dir-workers 4] [--hash-cap-mb 100]
                  [--exclude <glob>]... [--no-default-excludes]
                  [--retry-attempts 3] [--checkpoint-every 10000]
                  [--follow-symlinks] [--dry-run] [-v]

share-analyzer rescan [<path>] --db <file.db>
                  [--from-run <id>] [--workers 8] [--dir-workers 4]
                  [--hash-cap-mb 100]
                  [--exclude <glob>]... [--no-default-excludes]
                  [--retry-attempts 3] [--checkpoint-every 10000]
                  [--follow-symlinks] [-v]

share-analyzer report <name|all> --db <file.db> --out <dir>
                  [--format html|csv|jsonl|all] [--run-id <id>]

share-analyzer info --db <file.db> [--run-id <id>]
```

**Pre-flight `--dry-run`.** `share-analyzer scan PATH --dry-run` walks
the share without fingerprinting and without writing a database. It
prints file/folder counts, total size, top extensions, and a few
sample paths — useful as a sanity check before committing to a
multi-hour scan.

**Parallel directory enumeration.** `--dir-workers N` parallelises
`os.scandir` across N threads. Default 4. On a high-latency SMB share
the walk is usually the bottleneck rather than fingerprinting, so
this typically pays off. Set to 1 for sequential debugging.

**Default excludes.** `scan` and `rescan` apply a curated list that
filters the usual Windows nuisance files: Office lock files (`~$*`),
`Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `*.tmp`, `$RECYCLE.BIN`, `.DS_Store`, and a
handful of system files. Disable with `--no-default-excludes` or
`[scan].default_excludes = false` in `share-analyzer.toml`.

**Transient I/O retries.** Network blips, locked files, Windows
`ERROR_NETNAME_DELETED`, … are retried with exponential backoff
(0.2 s / 1 s / 5 s by default). Tune with `--retry-attempts 0..N`;
`0` disables retries. Permanent errors (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`, …) are not
retried.

**Disconnect detection.** If the share unmounts mid-crawl, the run
ends with `status='disconnected'` (CLI exit code 2) instead of
masquerading as a successful scan with thousands of bogus errors.
Folder aggregates aren't materialised on a partial snapshot — re-run
`scan` once the mount is restored. Elevated-but-not-disconnected
error rates surface as a one-line advisory: `"high error rate: N
network-class errors in the last 10s — consider lowering --workers"`.

**Live progress.** When stderr is a tty, `scan` and `rescan` redraw a
single line every half-second:

```
[scan]    123,456 files     842 f/s    7 err  …/share/Projects/alpha/docs/notes.md
```

Counts are absolute, the rate is computed over the whole run, and the
path is the most recently flushed file (or the path that just
errored). Long paths are truncated from the left so the tail —
the informative part — stays visible. On non-tty streams (CI logs,
redirected stdout), the live line is suppressed; only the final
summary is printed.

**UNC paths** work without `net use`: pass `\\server\share\path`
directly on Windows.

**`rescan`** re-walks the share, reuses prior SHA-256 + MIME for files
whose `(size, mtime)` are unchanged (within a 2 s tolerance to absorb
SMB1/FAT/NTFS rounding differences), fingerprints only the delta, and
records added / modified / deleted rows so reports can show churn.
Defaults to diffing against the most recent completed run.

**Path-derived tags.** Every indexed file gets a `tags` column —
folder names from its path, lowercased and deduped, with drive
letters / Windows long-path prefixes / hidden+system folders /
common organisational chrome (`shared`, `backup`, `final`, …)
stripped out. Surfaced in the RAG candidate JSONL so downstream
ingestion can filter by tag without re-parsing paths:

```json
{
  "path": "Z:\\maschinen\\12345\\anleitungen\\gasmesser\\xyz.pdf",
  "tags": ["maschinen", "12345", "anleitungen", "gasmesser"],
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size": 5242880,
  "...": "..."
}
```

A `share-analyzer.toml` in the working directory (or any parent) supplies
persistent defaults; CLI flags override.

```toml
[scan]
workers = 16
hash_cap_mb = 100
exclude = ["*.tmp", "Thumbs.db", "~$*"]
```

## Architecture

Three layers, each behind an interface so phase 2 can swap pieces without
touching the reports:

```
crawl/      Walker → Fingerprinter → Sink (orchestrated, bounded queues)
index/      schema + migrations + aggregation queries
reports/    Jinja2 templates + Plotly figures, file-system free
```

Phase 1 ships `LocalScandirWalker`, `StreamingFingerprinter`, `SqliteSink`.
Phase 2 plugs in `SmbDirectWalker`, `IncrementalSink`, `PostgresSink`, and a
`Mutator` write-back layer without rewrites.

## Data model

Single SQLite database, WAL mode, schema-versioned via the `schema_version`
table. Core tables:

- `crawl_runs`     — one row per scan
- `files`          — full metadata + sha256 + MIME per file
- `folders`        — materialised aggregates per folder (file count, size,
                      max depth below, mtime range, dominant MIME category)
- `crawl_errors`   — every skipped item with a reason
- `crawl_checkpoint` — resume seed for phase 2 incremental scans
- `mime_categories` — text-extractable / ocr-needed / media / archive /
                      executable / other
- `duplicates`     — view grouping files by sha256 with count ≥ 2

## Development

```bash
poetry install --with dev
poetry run pytest
```

The test suite covers crawler robustness (permission denied, unicode,
long paths, symlink loops, hash cap, exclude globs), schema migrations,
and report generation against a fixture share.

## Distribution

A single-binary Windows build is produced via PyInstaller:

```bash
poetry run pyinstaller --onefile --name share-analyzer share_analyzer/__main__.py
```

## Phase 1 scope

In: read-only crawl, SQLite index, six reports, JSONL hand-off.
Out: ACL/PII scanning, write-back, incremental rescan, SMB-direct, multi-share
federation, full-text indexing, web UI.
